Upgrade the DiceBattle game to a full turn-based battle system with deeper mechanics.

========================
GAME STRUCTURE
========================

Implement proper turn-based combat:

State variables:
- playerHP (start 100)
- aiHP (start 100)
- isPlayerTurn (true initially)
- battleLog (array of strings)
- shieldActive (boolean)
- xp
- coins
- isPro (affects XP multiplier)

========================
PLAYER TURN LOGIC
========================

When player clicks "Roll Dice":

1. Generate random number (1–6)
2. Apply rules:

If dice === 6:
   - Critical Hit → 35 damage to AI
   - Add log: "🔥 Critical Hit! 35 damage!"

If dice === 1:
   - Self damage → Player loses 10 HP
   - Add log: "💥 Bad luck! You hurt yourself."

If dice > 3 (4 or 5):
   - Normal attack → 20 damage

If dice <= 3 (2 or 3):
   - Activate shield
   - Add log: "🛡 Shield activated for next attack"

After player action:
- Switch to AI turn after short delay (800ms)

========================
AI TURN LOGIC
========================

AI randomly attacks:
- Random damage between 10–25

If shieldActive:
   - Reduce AI damage by 50%
   - Reset shieldActive to false
   - Add log: "🛡 Shield reduced damage!"

Apply damage to player.

Switch back to player turn.

========================
WIN CONDITION
========================

If AI HP <= 0:
   - Show Victory Modal
   - XP reward = 50
   - If isPro → XP reward = 100
   - Coins reward = 20
   - Add to user state
   - Show button: "Play Again"

If Player HP <= 0:
   - Show Defeat Modal
   - XP reward = 10
   - Show button: "Try Again"

========================
BATTLE LOG
========================

Display last 5 battle events.
Auto-scroll newest at bottom.

========================
UI IMPROVEMENTS
========================

- Disable roll button during AI turn
- Add HP bar animation effect
- Add small shake effect on damage
- Add smooth transitions

========================
RESET FUNCTION
========================

Create resetBattle() function that:
- Restores HP to 100
- Clears log
- Resets shield
- Sets player turn true

========================
IMPORTANT
========================

Keep code modular.
Add comments.
Do not break existing layout.
Keep it production structured.
